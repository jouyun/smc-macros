# smc-macros
Complete suite of ImageJ/Fiji macros written by Sean McKinney for performing various image processing tasks at the Stowers Institute.
Most of these macros require Fiji, and many require the "Stowers" plugin package to be installed.  

In order to install the "Stowers" plugin package in Fiji:
Help->Update->Manage update sites and select "Stowers".
